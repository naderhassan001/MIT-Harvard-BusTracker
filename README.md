<h1 align="center">MIT to Harvard Bus Tracker</h1>

<p align="center">
This is a bus stop tracker between the MIT maimn cumpus and the Harvard. We were allowed to use some of the libraries at Harvard, so we all made variations of this bus tracker to track our stops. This program measures all the possible stops by bus. The 38 bus route runs through this route and this program runs maps all the stops.
